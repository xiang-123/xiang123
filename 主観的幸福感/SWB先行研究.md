  - Psychologists still argue about how happi- ness should be defined, but few would deny that people de- sire it.
  - it is important to not only measure well-being, but also attend to factors that contribute to, support, and improve it (Abramovitz, Scitovsky, and Inkeles 1973; Layard 2005; Seligman 2011)
  - Subjective well-being is not just an end in itself; there is increasing evidence that well-being improves multiple life domains, including health and immunity (Howell, Kern, and Lyubomirsky 2007), cardiovascular disease (Boehm and
Richard E. Lucas　Michigan State University 583　Kubzansky 2012), career outcomes and social relationships (Lyubomirsky, King, and Diener 2005; Pressman and Cohen 2005), as well as longevity (Diener and Chan 2011). For ex- ample, **college students who reported higher levels of cheer- fulness also had higher incomes, greater job satisfaction, and less unemployment 19 years later (Diener et al. 2002)**.
  - Others have looked at variation in posi- tive and negative emotion word use in tweets, Facebook, or blogs across time (Dodds et al. 2011; Kramer 2010) or lat- itude (Dodds and Danforth 2010). Such methods, though useful for other goals, do not capture many of the nuances of subjective well being.
