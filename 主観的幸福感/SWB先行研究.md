### 定義
- 「Subjective well-being refers to how people evaluate their lives in terms of cognition (i.e., satisfaction with life) and emotion (positive and negative emotion). 」
### 尺度
- 生活満足度（life satisfaction・LS）
  - 「Here, we specifically focus on the cognitive-based evalu- ation of overall life satisfaction (LS), a broader evaluation of well-being than emotion alone provides.」
    - 「LS has been widely studied in the psychological litera- ture (Diener et al. 1999) and has been tracked by the CDC through their Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, as well as by numerous countries around the world; **the OECD has recently established authoritative guidelines for the measurement of subjective well-being (OECD 2013)**. 
      - It is assessed by asking people to respond to questions such as “In general, how satisfied are you with your life?”, with re- sponses ranging from ”very dissatisfied” to ”very satisfied” (Diener et al. 1985). 
      - The response to such simple questions has provided useful comparisons of well-being both within and between nations (Diener et al. 2010). 
      - Although LS is a single indicator, it is influenced by many important areas of life such as having sufficient food and shelter, good re- lationships, and having the freedom to choose one’s daily activities (Diener et al. 1985).

  - Psychologists still argue about how happi- ness should be defined, but few would deny that people de- sire it.
  - it is important to not only measure well-being, but also attend to factors that contribute to, support, and improve it (Abramovitz, Scitovsky, and Inkeles 1973; Layard 2005; Seligman 2011)
  - Our goal here is not to count positive sentiment words, but study the language of well-being, to better understand the multiple components that contribute to it.
  - Most of the happi- ness research in social media has focused on the emotion component (i.e., sentiment analysis).
  - Subjective well-being is not just an end in itself; there is increasing evidence that well-being improves multiple life domains, including health and immunity (Howell, Kern, and Lyubomirsky 2007), cardiovascular disease (Boehm and
Richard E. Lucas　Michigan State University 583　Kubzansky 2012), career outcomes and social relationships (Lyubomirsky, King, and Diener 2005; Pressman and Cohen 2005), as well as longevity (Diener and Chan 2011). For ex- ample, **college students who reported higher levels of cheer- fulness also had higher incomes, greater job satisfaction, and less unemployment 19 years later (Diener et al. 2002)**.
  - Others have looked at variation in posi- tive and negative emotion word use in tweets, Facebook, or blogs across time (Dodds et al. 2011; Kramer 2010) or lat- itude (Dodds and Danforth 2010). Such methods, though useful for other goals, do not capture many of the nuances of subjective well being.
- PERMA:five components of positive psychology
  - Positive emotion (aglow, awesome, bliss . . . )
  - Engagement (absorbed, attentive, busy. . . )
  - Relationships (admiring, agreeable. . . )
  - Meaning (aspire, belong . . . ) 
  - Achievement (accomplish, achieve, attain. . . )

- 定義：happiness is primarily a product of the positive assessments of life situations and favorable comparisons of these life situations with those of others and in the past. (幸福主要是对生活状况的积极评价以及对这些生活状况与其他人或过去的生活状况进行有利的比较的结果。)
    - this judgement is still reflected in today’s literature (Zikmund, 2003; Rees, Goswami, & Bradshaw 2010; Stratham & Chase, 2010). 
- quality of life
    - **WHOによる定義**
        - an individual’s perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept affected in a complex way by the person’s physical health, psychological state, personal beliefs, social relationships and their relationship to salient features of their environment (World Health Organization, 1997)个人在其所处的文化和价值体系背景下，以及在与其目标、期望、标准和关注点相关的情况下，对其在生活中地位的看法。它是一个范围广泛的概念，以复杂的方式受到人的身体健康、心理状态、个人信仰、社会关系及其与环境显著特征的关系的影响。
        - Dodge(2012):**a problem with the term ‘quality of life’ is that it is used interchangeably with ‘wellbeing’ in a variety of disciplines.(“quality of life”这个术语的一个问题是，它与“wellbeing”在各种学科中可以互换使用)**

        - Psychometric properties（心理测量特性）:The WHO-5 has been found to have adequate validity in screening for depression and in measuring outcomes in clinical trials. Item response theory analyses in studies of younger persons and elderly persons indicate that the measure has good construct validity as a unidimensional scale measuring well-being in these populations (Winther Topp et al., 2015).已发现 WHO-5 在筛查抑郁症和测量临床试验结果方面具有足够的效度。对年轻人和老年人的研究中的项目反应理论分析表明，该测量作为一维量表具有良好的结构效度衡量这些人群的幸福感

            - 結論：「the WHO-5 is a highly useful tool that can be applied in both clinical practice (for instance to screen for depression) as well as in research studies in order to assess well-being over time or to compare well-being between groups.」 （WHO-5是一个非常有用的工具，可以应用于临床实践（例如筛查抑郁症）和研究，以评估一段时间内的幸福感或比较各组之间的幸福感。）
