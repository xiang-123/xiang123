### 定義
- 「Subjective well-being refers to how people evaluate their lives in terms of cognition (i.e., satisfaction with life) and emotion (positive and negative emotion). 」
### 尺度
- 生活満足度（life satisfaction・LS）
  - 「Here, we specifically focus on the cognitive-based evalu- ation of overall life satisfaction (LS), a broader evaluation of well-being than emotion alone provides.」
    - 「LS has been widely studied in the psychological litera- ture (Diener et al. 1999) and has been tracked by the CDC through their Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, as well as by numerous countries around the world; **the OECD has recently established authoritative guidelines for the measurement of subjective well-being (OECD 2013)**. 
      - It is assessed by asking people to respond to questions such as “In general, how satisfied are you with your life?”, with re- sponses ranging from ”very dissatisfied” to ”very satisfied” (Diener et al. 1985). 
      - The response to such simple questions has provided useful comparisons of well-being both within and between nations (Diener et al. 2010). 
      - Although LS is a single indicator, it is influenced by many important areas of life such as having sufficient food and shelter, good re- lationships, and having the freedom to choose one’s daily activities (Diener et al. 1985).

  - Psychologists still argue about how happi- ness should be defined, but few would deny that people de- sire it.
  - it is important to not only measure well-being, but also attend to factors that contribute to, support, and improve it (Abramovitz, Scitovsky, and Inkeles 1973; Layard 2005; Seligman 2011)
  - Our goal here is not to count positive sentiment words, but study the language of well-being, to better understand the multiple components that contribute to it.
  - Most of the happi- ness research in social media has focused on the emotion component (i.e., sentiment analysis).
  - Subjective well-being is not just an end in itself; there is increasing evidence that well-being improves multiple life domains, including health and immunity (Howell, Kern, and Lyubomirsky 2007), cardiovascular disease (Boehm and
Richard E. Lucas　Michigan State University 583　Kubzansky 2012), career outcomes and social relationships (Lyubomirsky, King, and Diener 2005; Pressman and Cohen 2005), as well as longevity (Diener and Chan 2011). For ex- ample, **college students who reported higher levels of cheer- fulness also had higher incomes, greater job satisfaction, and less unemployment 19 years later (Diener et al. 2002)**.
  - Others have looked at variation in posi- tive and negative emotion word use in tweets, Facebook, or blogs across time (Dodds et al. 2011; Kramer 2010) or lat- itude (Dodds and Danforth 2010). Such methods, though useful for other goals, do not capture many of the nuances of subjective well being.

### 定義
- 「quality of life」
  - 「an individual’s perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept affected in a complex way by the person’s physical health, psychological state, personal beliefs, social relationships and their relationship to salient features of their environment **(World Health Organization, 1997)**」

       - Psychometric properties（心理测量特性）:The WHO-5 has been found to have adequate validity in screening for depression and in measuring outcomes in clinical trials. Item response theory analyses in studies of younger persons and elderly persons indicate that the measure has good construct validity as a unidimensional scale measuring well-being in these populations (Winther Topp et al., 2015).

  - Speech-enabled CAs, in comparison, may offer the opportunity to obtain richer insight into individuals’ experience of mental health and illness—whether for sharing with health profession- als [65], to support individuals’ own insight [50], or perhaps even to serve as part of health and well-being interventions [28, 86]. 
  - **Studies have shown that speech, as a primary mode of commu- nication, can engage users in more natural and human-to-humanlike conversations, suggesting the potential of these systems to improve user engagement and self-report response quality while fostering more honest and insightful forms of self-disclosure [23, 50].**
  - Smart speaker devices including Google’s Home and Amazon’s Alexa have seen a surge in popu-larity in recent years following advancements in speech recognition technology—rendering these technologies increasingly feasible means of interaction and even leading to increased application of these systems in healthcare [38, 40, 41, 44, 66, 84]. **According to one recent survey, 52.0% of 1,004 U.S. adults possess an interest in the use of Conversational Agent (CA)s, while 7.5% have already made use of a CA for a healthcare-related task or inquiry, from inquiring about symptoms of illness (73.0%), to searching for information concerning medication use (45.9%), or seeking care and treatment options (37.7%) [11].**

### 定義
- 「Subjectivewell-being(SWB),people’semotionalandcognitiveevalu- ations of their lives, includes what lay people call happiness, peace, fulfillment, and life satisfaction. 」
- 「The field of subjective well-being (SWB) comprises the scientific analysis of how people evaluate their lives—both at the moment and for longer periods such as for the past year. 」
  - 「These evaluations include people’s emotional reactions to events, their moods, and judgments they form about their life satisfaction, fulfillment, and satisfaction with domains such as marriage and work.」
- 「Although each of the components of SWB reflects people’s evaluations of what is happening in their lives, the facets of SWB such as **positive affect**, **lack of negative affect**, and **life satisfaction** show some degree of **independence** (Andrews & Withey 1976, Lucas et al. 1996) and **therefore should be measured and studied individually.**」

  - 「Another influence on the field came from researchers working in the area of mental health, who wanted to extend the idea of mental health beyond the absence of symptoms of depression and distress to also include the presence of happiness　and **life satisfaction** (e.g., Jahoda 1958). 」
 - p405
  - 「SWB is measured in a variety of ways. For the　 **emotional components**, for exam-ple feelings of joy and contentment, broad survey measures have been used (e.g., “In general how happy are you?”), as well as experience sampling of moods and emotions over time and informant reports from family and friends. 」
  - 「**The cognitive component of SWB has been assessed with life satisfaction surveys and also with measures of satisfaction and fulfillment in various life domains** such as marriage, work, and leisure (see Sandvik et al. 1993 for a description of alternative methods of measurement of SWB).」
