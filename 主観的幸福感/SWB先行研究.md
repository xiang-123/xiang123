### 定義
- 「Subjective well-being refers to how people evaluate their lives in terms of cognition (i.e., satisfaction with life) and emotion (positive and negative emotion). 」
### 尺度
- 生活満足度（life satisfaction・LS）
  - 「Here, we specifically focus on the cognitive-based evalu- ation of overall life satisfaction (LS), a broader evaluation of well-being than emotion alone provides.」
    - 「LS has been widely studied in the psychological litera- ture (Diener et al. 1999) and has been tracked by the CDC through their Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, as well as by numerous countries around the world; **the OECD has recently established authoritative guidelines for the measurement of subjective well-being (OECD 2013)**. 
      - It is assessed by asking people to respond to questions such as “In general, how satisfied are you with your life?”, with re- sponses ranging from ”very dissatisfied” to ”very satisfied” (Diener et al. 1985). 
      - The response to such simple questions has provided useful comparisons of well-being both within and between nations (Diener et al. 2010). 
      - Although LS is a single indicator, it is influenced by many important areas of life such as having sufficient food and shelter, good re- lationships, and having the freedom to choose one’s daily activities (Diener et al. 1985).

  - Psychologists still argue about how happi- ness should be defined, but few would deny that people de- sire it.
  - it is important to not only measure well-being, but also attend to factors that contribute to, support, and improve it (Abramovitz, Scitovsky, and Inkeles 1973; Layard 2005; Seligman 2011)
  - Our goal here is not to count positive sentiment words, but study the language of well-being, to better understand the multiple components that contribute to it.
  - Most of the happi- ness research in social media has focused on the emotion component (i.e., sentiment analysis).
  - Subjective well-being is not just an end in itself; there is increasing evidence that well-being improves multiple life domains, including health and immunity (Howell, Kern, and Lyubomirsky 2007), cardiovascular disease (Boehm and
Richard E. Lucas　Michigan State University 583　Kubzansky 2012), career outcomes and social relationships (Lyubomirsky, King, and Diener 2005; Pressman and Cohen 2005), as well as longevity (Diener and Chan 2011). For ex- ample, **college students who reported higher levels of cheer- fulness also had higher incomes, greater job satisfaction, and less unemployment 19 years later (Diener et al. 2002)**.
  - Others have looked at variation in posi- tive and negative emotion word use in tweets, Facebook, or blogs across time (Dodds et al. 2011; Kramer 2010) or lat- itude (Dodds and Danforth 2010). Such methods, though useful for other goals, do not capture many of the nuances of subjective well being.

  - Engagement (absorbed, attentive, busy. . . )
  - Relationships (admiring, agreeable. . . )

  - Achievement (accomplish, achieve, attain. . . )
